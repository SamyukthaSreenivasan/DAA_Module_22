# EX 4D DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING â€“ 4
## DATE: 25.5.2025
## AIM:
To find the minimum number of operations to convert str1 to str2 using Naive recursive method.

## Algorithm
1.If one string is empty, return the length of the other string.
2.If the last characters of both strings match, the cost is 0; else, cost is 1.
3.Recursively calculate three options: insert, delete, or replace a character.
4.Take the minimum of the three operations plus the current cost.
5.Final result is the minimum number of edits needed to convert one string into another.   

## Program:

def LD(s, t):
    
    if s == "":
        return len(t)
    if t == "":
        return len(s)
    if s[-1] == t[-1]:
        cost = 0
    else:
        cost = 1
    res = min([LD(s[:-1], t)+1, LD(s, t[:-1])+1, LD(s[:-1], t[:-1]) + cost])
    return res
str1=input()
str2=input()
print('Edit Distance',LD(str1,str2))
```

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding edit distance between two strings.
